    text: "This is a well written book with excellent character development. The characters come to life as you read the story and it sucks you in quickly, wanting to know what is going to happen next and it pulls you through the entire gambit of emotions. You will, laugh, get mad, and cry before you get to the end. I am anxiously awaiting the release of book 2 in a couple of weeks to see how the journey continues.",
