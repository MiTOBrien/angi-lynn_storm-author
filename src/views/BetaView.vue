  <h2>Beta Reader Application</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      There are times I am looking for extra sets of eyes on my work. By signing up you will get a
      pre-release version of my book to read and in return you can provide your thoughts on
      character development, storyline and story flow, and any other aspects of the story you wish
      to provide feedback on. I value your feedback and if this is something you are interested in
      read the expections below and sign up.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Agreement</h3>
    <h4>Beta Reader Expections</h4>
    <p>
      As a beta reader you will be expected to comply with the following. Failure to comply will
      result in you being removed from my beta reader list and you will not be considered for future
      beta reading opporunties.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide valuable/insightful feedback to the author in a timely fashion. "Good book", "Didn't
        like it" aren't good or insightful feedback so take the time to give the author meaningful
        feeback on their work. You're reading this before everyone else and have an opporuntity to
        help influence the final release.
        <br /><strong>NOTE: </strong>You should be able to provide your initial feedback within 2
        weeks of receiving the book. If you want to reread or provide more in depth feedback all
        feedback should be provided within 4 weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agree not to share this book with anyone else or discuss it with anyone else. You have the
        privilege of receiving a pre-release of the authors work before it is published and it may
        be book 2 or 3 in a series. Other people may want to know what is "coming next" for their
        favorite character but they just have to wait. Keep it to yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are a professional beta reader you acknowledge that my reviews of your services will
        be provided on free social media sites such as instagram, facebook, and threads. Feedback
        will not be provided on paid sites such as Fiverr, Upwork, or similar sites.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Author Expections</h4>
    <p>As the author I agree to comply with the following.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I will provide the book to you in the format you requested within the agreed upon timeline.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will read, and thoughtfully consider all feedback that is provided by all of my beta
        readers.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are a professional beta reader I agree to provide you timely, honest feedback on the
        quality of your services to one, or more of your free social media sites such as instagram,
        facebook, and threads. Feedback will not be provided on paid sites such as Fiverr, Upwork,
        or similar sites.

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is free beta reading. Before final publishing I have people I pay
