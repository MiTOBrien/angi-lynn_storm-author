  <h2>Beta Reader Application</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      There are times I am looking for extra sets of eyes on my work. By signing up you will get a
      pre-release version of my book to read and in return you can provide your thoughts on
      character development, storyline and story flow, and any other aspects of the story you wish
      to provide feedback on. I value your feedback and if this is something you are interested in
      read the expections below and sign up.
    </p>
    <h3>Expectations</h3>
    <p>
      As a beta reader you will be expected to comply with the following. Failure to comply will
      result in you being removed from my beta reader list and you will not be considered for future
      beta reading opporunties.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide valuable/insightful feedback to the author in a timely fashion. "Good book", "Didn't
        like it" aren't good or insightful feedback so take the time to give the author meaningful
        feeback on their work. You're reading this before everyone else and have an opporuntity to
        help influence the final release.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agree not to share this book with anyone else or discuss it with anyone else. You have the
        privilege of receiving a pre-release of the authors work before it is published and it may
        be book 2 or 3 in a series. Other people may want to know what is "coming next" for their
        favorite character but they just have to wait. Keep it to yourself.
