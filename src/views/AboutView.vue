    <h2>The Author</h2>
    <p>
      Angi-Lynn Storm was born in Iowa in 1977. Growing up in a small town she spent a lot of time
      at the library where she fell in love with reading. This allowed her to visit places in her
      mind that she couldn't visit in real life and developed her imagination. Through high school,
      college, and her early career she still held her passion for reading and began to expand her
      reading, delving into a wider variety of genres, eventually finding a love for things a little
      more on the edge - paranormal, shifters, and reverse harem. She has become an avid reader of
      fantasy and paranormal genres, and loves to share her own narrative, weaving together worlds
      full of magic, danger, and complex relationships.

      Fast forward a few years and an idea formed in her head for a book that she couldn't make go
      away. Deciding to just "get it out of her head" she sat down and started writing. One page
      became 10, one chapter turned into 20, and then there it was, her first book actually written:
      Bunnies of Thornmaw - Blossom's Story. While this book has yet to be published, it sparked a
      passion for writing that still continues. Here is a link to Ream Stories if you want to read

      or some of her other works in progress. Her next idea for a book series quickly came to mind
      and fingers were flying over the keyboard again and Madison came to life as the main character
      in the Wolzen-Whitaker Academy series, a 3 book series that was her first series published on
      Amazon.

      Though her writing journey is a relatively new one, her imagination and dedication to
      storytelling have already shaped her unique voice. She credits her inspiration to the dream
      that launched her creative process, and she finds joy in bringing the characters and worlds in
      her mind to life on paper.

      When she isn't writing, she enjoys spending time with her supportive sisterwife and their
      husband, who have been a constant source of encouragement as she navigates her new writing
      path. Together, they create a loving and stable environment that fuels her creativity.
