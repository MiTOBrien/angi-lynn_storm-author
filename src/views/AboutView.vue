    <h2>The Author</h2>
    <p>
      Angi-Lynn Storm was born in Iowa in 1977. Growing up in a small town she spent a lot of time
      at the library where she fell in love with reading. This allowed to visit in places in her
      mind that she couldn't visit in real life and developed her imagination. Through high school,
      college, and her early career she still held her passion for reading and began to expand
      reading delving into a wider variety of genres, eventually finding a love for things a little
      more on the edge - paranormal, shifers, and reverse harem being at the forefront.

      Fast forward a few years and an idea formed in her head for a book that she couldn't make go
      away. Deciding to just "get it out of her head" she sat down and started writing. One page
      became 10, one chapter turned into 20, and then there it was, her first book actually written
      - Bunnies of Thornmaw - Bloosom's Story. While this book has yet to be published, it sparked a
      passion for writing that still continues. Here is a link to Ream Stories if you want to read

      or some other works in progress. Her next idea for a book series quickly came to mind and
      fingers were flying over the keyboard again and Madison came to life as the main character in
      the Wolzen-Whitaker Academy series, a 3 book series that was her first series published on
      Amazon.
